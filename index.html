<h1><a id="JWTConnect_2"></a>JWTConnect</h1>
<p>JWTConnect is a collection of OpenIDConnect (OIDC) Relaying Party (RP) Client libraries.<br>
    Presently only the Python language implementation is available, soon to be made available are Java and<br>
    JavaScript libraries too.</p>
<p>JWTConnect aims at being complete OIDC RP implementations. We also strive to make them as secure as possible.</p>
<h2><a id="The_overall_architecture_10"></a>The overall architecture.</h2>
<p>Independent of programming language a common design criteria was that programmers moving between the<br>
    languages should recognise the layout.<br>
    We have therefor tried to keep the APIs as similar as possible.</p>
<p>Working with the implementations we split the work into 4 layers. Each layer depends on underlying layers.<br>
    Starting from the lowest layer and working upwards this is a very high level description of each of them:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>cryptojwt</strong><br>
            Implements RFC 7515-7519 and tools for handling cryptographic keys</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>oidcmsg</strong><br>
            Implements a basic Message class with methods for deserialising and serialising to/fro
            urlencoded/json/jwt.<br>
            <em>Oidcmsg</em> defines subclasses for all the requests/responses in OAuth2/OIDC.<br>
            Each subclass has a verify method that based on information in the subclass about required/optional<br>
            claims for a specific response/request, their types and in some cases allowed values, can verify that
            the<br>
            message is correct as specified by the standard.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>oidcservice</strong><br>
            The RP uses services provided by an AS/OP. Services like web finger, provider info discovery,
            authorisation<br>
            and so on. Each of these services are represented by a subclass of a general Service class. Each service
            class<br>
            has access to a Service Context class which keeps information which is specific to an AS/OP but
            independent<br>
            of which user is using the RP to talk to an AS/OP. To keep user specific information there is an
            interface<br>
            to a State database.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>oidcrp</strong><br>
            Implements the interface that an implementor that wants to add RP functionality to a program/service<br>
            should use. A normal implementor should never have to bother with the underlying libraries.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
